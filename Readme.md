## **React Native bridging into a physical world**

Physical world slowly becomes entwined with the web. Today more and more devices are connected to the cloud and controlled by bluetooth low energy. Since our mobile phones are capable of connecting them, more and more apps emerge, which act as controllers for such devices. Smart lightbulbs, Indoor navigation using iBeacons and Physical Web and much more. In this talk we will look into how we can create React Native apps that are capable of such things.

## **Piloting a drone with React - IoT**

JavaScript is everywhere. In 2017 it's running not only in the browser and even not only on the server. Nowadays you can program IoT devices with JavaScript too. But you don't need to know other techniques than those used on Web. React - IoT is a library that lets you write React components that are "rendered" to the board.

In this talk we will walk through this library and how it works under the hood, what abilities it gives you. At the end we will fly a drone using React-IoT and Raspberry Pi

## **The Hitchhikers guide to Virtual Reality on the Web**

VR is taking word by a storm. We see tons of games, applications, movies and generally content created for VR platforms both mobile and high end devices such as Oculus Rift, HTC Vive, Playstation VR. After release of Firefox Quantum browser VR is available right in your browser meaning with JavaScript you can create awesome VR content running on your web page. In this talk we will get to know what WebVR is and how you can use it today.

## Accessibility and VR

Accessibility and VR can be perceived from two angles. First is how we can use VR to bring experiences to people with disabilities, something they for cannot achieve in real life. Other angle is how VR can still be used for people with vision disabilities. In this talk we will discuss both angles of Accessibility in VR and understand how VR can be the perfect platform for everyone

In this talk I will show various examples how VR apps can be used to bring amazing experiences to people with disabilities, how VR apps should be created with accessibility in mind and how UX would ultimately change when world will get more and more into VR

## **Psychology of User Experience for digital dimensions**

Virtual and Augmented realities overlay or merge digital and real worlds. In that sense they create different dimension or alternate universe. But how human should interact with it? User experience is so different from the one we are used to on digital media. In this talk we will look into the present and future of user interactions in digital realities and will discuss psychology behind techniques used or that will probably be used in the future.

>tags: UX, conceptual, design

## Design Best Practices in Virtual Reality
UI and UX as we know it is historically based on 2D screens. When we moved to design in 3d for let's say video games it is different, but not as different as for VR. In this talk we will discuss various practices to designing user friendly and natural experiences for VR

>tags: UX, design
